Currently, the provided dataset, trained model file ldfgnet.hdf5, xmodel file :ldfgnet.xmoldel, .pb file, all are dummy files.

The original dataset can be available from: https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir/
The main program is gi_classification.ipynb, which contains TensorFlow code to read, augment, train, and perform inference, but the model file will be updated soon. 

Currently, you can replace any pretrained model in place of that and execute the code to save the trained file as an HDF5 file.
After executing the code from vitis_ai, the required file will be automatically generated.
